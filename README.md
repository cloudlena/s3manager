## Features

- List all buckets in your account
- Create a new bucket
- List all objects in a bucket
- Upload new objects to a bucket
- Download object from a bucket
- Delete an object in a bucket

## Usage

### Configuration

The application can be configured with the following environment variables:

- `ENDPOINT`: The endpoint of your S3 server (defaults to `s3.amazonaws.com`)
- `REGION`: The region of your S3 server (defaults to `""`)
- `ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your S3 access key ID (required) (works only if `USE_IAM` is `false`)
- `SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your S3 secret access key (required) (works only if `USE_IAM` is `false`)
- `USE_SSL`: Whether your S3 server uses SSL or not (defaults to `true`)
- `SKIP_SSL_VERIFICATION`: Whether the HTTP client should skip SSL verification (defaults to `false`)
- `SIGNATURE_TYPE`: The signature type to be used (defaults to `V4`; valid values are `V2, V4, V4Streaming, Anonymous`)
- `PORT`: The port the s3manager app should listen on (defaults to `8080`)
- `ALLOW_DELETE`: Enable buttons to delete objects (defaults to `true`)
- `FORCE_DOWNLOAD`: Add response headers for object downloading instead of opening in a new tab (defaults to `true`)
- `LIST_RECURSIVE`: List all objects in buckets recursively (defaults to `false`)
- `USE_IAM`: Use IAM role instead of key pair (defaults to `false`)
- `IAM_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint for IAM role retrieving (Can be blank for AWS)
- `SSE_TYPE`: Specified server side encrpytion (defaults blank) Valid values can be `SSE`, `KMS`, `SSE-C` all others values don't enable the SSE
- `SSE_KEY`: The key needed for SSE method (only for `KMS` and `SSE-C`)
- `TIMEOUT`: The read and write timout in seconds (default to `600` - 10 minutes)
- `ROOT_URL`: A root url prefix if running behind a reverse proxy (defaults to unset)

### Build and Run Locally

1.  Run `make build`
1.  Execute the created binary and visit <http://localhost:8080>

### Run Container image

1. Run `docker run -p 8080:8080 -e 'ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX' -e 'SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=xxx' cloudlena/s3manager`

### Deploy to Kubernetes

You can deploy s3manager to a Kubernetes cluster using the [Helm chart](https://github.com/sergeyshevch/s3manager-helm).

#### Running behind a reverse proxy

If there are multiple S3 users/accounts in a site then multiple instances of the S3 manager can be run in Kubernetes and expose behind a single nginx reverse proxy ingress.
The s3manager can be run with a `ROOT_URL` environment variable set that accounts for the reverse proxy location.

If the nginx configuration block looks like:

```code
    location /teamx/ {
        proxy_pass http://s3manager-teamx:8080/;
        auth_basic "teamx";
        auth_basic_user_file /conf/teamx-htpasswd;
    }
    location /teamy/ {
        proxy_pass http://s3manager-teamy:8080/;
        <other nginx settings>
    }
```

then the instance behind the `s3manager-teamx` service has `ROOT_URL=teamx` and the instance behind `s3manager-teamy` has `ROOT_URL=teamy`.
Other nginx settings can be applied to each location.
The nginx instance can be hosted on some reachable address and reverse proxy to the different s3 accounts.

## Development

### Lint Code

1. Run `make lint`

### Run Tests

1.  Run `make test`

### Build Container Image

The image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudlena/s3manager/).

1.  Run `make build-image`

### Run Locally for Testing

There is an example [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/cloudlena/s3manager/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file that spins up an S3 service and the s3manager. You can try it by issuing the following command:

```shell
$ docker-compose up
```
